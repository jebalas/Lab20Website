            <h1>Jennifer Elizabeth Erven</h1>
            <p>Service, diligence, teamwork, honest communication and flexibility are the values on which I’ve built my career. As a former engineer, I’ve effectively transitioned my love of detail and continuous improvement to the realms of both education and operations. I draw energy and reward from planning and executing projects, building long-standing connections, and getting things done. </p>
